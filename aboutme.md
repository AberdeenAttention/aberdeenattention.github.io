Motivation
----------

The human body is comprised of a large collection of diverse cell types,
each providing a specialized and context-specific function. The advent of high-throughput
single-cell transcriptomics, has enabled unbiased categorization of diverse developmental
and diseased cellular trajectories. However, with current genome-wide approaches,
little can be done to understand: i) how cells vary through time, ii) how this variance
effects cellular decisions and iii) how TFs affect the activity of regulatory elements
(trans) and, in turn, how these elements lead to functional expression differences (cis).
Our lab seeks to address these challenges by developing the next-generation of biological
tools, tools that integrate molecular biology, microscopy and large-scale bioinformatics
to provide a systems-level understanding of single-cells.

Research Interests

<h3> Developing new ‘-omic’ technologies </h3>

Our group employs a mix set of skills relating to molecular biology, device engineering and microscopy.
We use these skills to leverage sequencing technologies to make high-throughput measurements that seek to
better understand gene regulation within living systems. For example, in previous work, we have developed
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v32/n6/abs/nbt.2880.html" target="_blank">RNA-MaP</a> and
Assay for Transpose Accessible Chromatin (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n12/abs/nmeth.2688.html" target="_blank">ATAC-seq</a>).
Notably, ATAC-seq has become an increasingly popular method to measure genome-wide chromatin accessibility, i.e. the epigenome.
Recently, we have also adapted this method to profile the epigenomes of single-cells
(<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v523/n7561/full/nature14590.html" target="_blank">scATAC-seq</a>).
We are actively developing technological tools for improving the quality and throughput of these measurements,
as well as integrating scATAC-seq with other single-cell ‘-omic’ measurements.<br><br>
